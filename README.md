# MassAudioDownloader
A lightweight and high power tool designed to download all of the .ogg game audio files from sites like game wikis.

I just wanted to download some game audio files from a game wiki for personal fun stuff, and it was such a pain. So I made this! Go ham, do whatever you want. You're responsible for downloading and using stuff responsibly!

INSTALLATION:
There's two versions: The Python source and the standalone executable.

A. You need to have python installed to use the python version lol. But if you don't trust .exe files on the internet, do that. It's easy, just download the repo and run the Setup.bat. Then you can use the Run.bat for each future use.

B. For the executable, just download the package and run MassAudioDownloader.exe and party hard!

HOW TO USE:
The application is very simple. Just find the webpages that have the .ogg audio files on them and copy-paste them into the text box in the MAD.

The URLs will collect into a list for you.

Then you can either:
A. Download the audio from the top of the entry in the list, you choose the directory and it will download all the audio it can find. That entry will be deleted from the list and you can repeat that for each entry, choosing each download location. All files downloaded this way will automaticcaly be converted to .wav files! Yay!

B. Download from every URL in the list. You choose the directory and it will create subfolders for each page automatically and download the files there. All files downloaded this way will automaticcaly be converted to .wav files! Yay!


Finally, if for some reason you have lots of .ogg files around, you can use the 'WAVify' button to turn all the .ogg files to .wav files for easy use.
